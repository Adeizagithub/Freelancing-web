                    About Me
                </h1>
                    <p class="lead">
                       <span style="margin-left: 20px;">My</span>  name is Angulu Julius and I am a web designer and/or developer for hire, I am an undergraduate currently schooling for his degree
                        in the prestigous
                         <a href="https://www.nileuniversity.edu.ng/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=2022firstintake_awareness_campaign&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0umSBhDrARIsAH7FCodLR0rzyyv7Eh1mamaD6Zwk75tPYuk3-sFuSppd3bDiPWDUMxLD70oaAiEtEALw_wcB">
                              Nile University of Nigeria</a>. But before applying for college, I always had a liking for computers and games as a young child and when
                              I reached the age of 12, I learned how these games were actually created, I learned that all computers need user interfaces if not ordinary people
                              won't be able to read the information the computer is trying to pass, I was intrigued to learn of this new world totally oblivious to a younger me who thought 
                              games and apps were just drawings filled with colours. It was at this time I discovered the world of computer programming/coding and I fell in love with the concept of creating
                              these games and apps that lit up my childhood, I realized that this is what I want to do with my Life and the next summer break I told my parents 
                              I didnt want to waste another summer break sitting at home playing, I told them that I wanted to learn the skill of web design, before then I had been
                              seeing posters of private schools that teach kids how to code and design websites and also learn how to code in python and java, but the child in me 
                              saw web design as more colourful and I told my mom and dad that I wanted to learn how to create websites and they liked the fact I was learning a new skill
                              and the fact they weren't the ones who forced me to do it. So the next day they called one of the numbers I took of the private school banners and called the number 
                              to get me signed up for the class. The next day i started the class at just 13 years old and I finished the entire web design/development in a couple of months and after that I've been learning
                              language after language. I am currently studying software engineering as my first degree and I am working as a freelancer on <a href="https://www.guru.com">Guru</a> 
                              as a web developer.

                            <span style="margin-left: 20px">Apart</span> from being a seasoned web designer/developer, I have had a number of jobs in the past, I have created 
                            websites for businesses around me and I have created many computer programming orientated projects when I was in high school 
                            for both the science fair and the talent show. I was known as "the boy who codes". I ventured into the world of crypto currency 
                            when I was in the 12th grade and I learnt about Decentralized finance(DEFI), but being a not so liquidated teenager I couldn't invest
                            and make profits like others were doing so I learnt how to work for these DEFI projects and get paid for my services. I began to work for these
                            project's telegram communities as a chat moderator where I gained huge knowledge about cryptocurrency and crypto projects.
